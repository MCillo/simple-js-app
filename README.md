Pokédex Web App

Description
This is the first responsive web app that I have created in my journey to become a Full Stack Web Developer. I am happy that this learning process has taught me so much and I realize that there is still a lot more to learn.

This App retrieves information from an external API and displays that information to the user. The information is initially displayed as a field of buttons the user can interact with. When the user triggers the button, a modal will display additional information about the selected Pokémon. There is also a search function that will narrow down the field as the user enters text into the search text box.

To view the app simply follow this link:   mcillo.github.io/simple-js-app/


The programming languages used for this app were:
•	HTML
•	CSS
•	JavaScript 
o	JavaScript version 1.5

Code snippets as well as Pokémon information were sourced from the following:
•	PokéAPI
•	Bootstrap
•	jQuery
